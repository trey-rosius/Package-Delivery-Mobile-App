# package_delivery

This is a POC mobile application for the [package-delivery-microservice-api](https://github.com/trey-rosius/package-delivery-microservice) created
with [Diagrid Catalyst API](https://pages.diagrid.io/catalyst-early-access-waitlist)

Please follow the link above and read more if you're interested in knowing about how the API was built.

Also, the application interacts with an AppSync Endpoint that encapsulates the microservice above.
